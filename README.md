# Retro SnakeGame

[Gameplay](./media/gameplay.mp4)

## Build Instructions

Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/horriedhenry/snakegame_raylib.git
```
Build

```bash
cd snakegame_raylib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Use `make` inside `build` directory to produce an executable (linux only)

```bash
make
```
The `make` command automatically launches the game. If not just run the `Snake` executable.

```bash
./Snake
```
Or move `Snake` executable to `/usr/local/bin/`, or anywhere you want for easy access.
